This guide will help you set up and run your authorization server(AS) that works as a frontend for Authlete. Follow these steps to create and configure your service, set up a demo authorization server, and test it.

## Requirements

This quickstart requires either:

- Docker 1.29 or later
- Java

## Step 1: Register for an Authlete Account

To manage and run authorization services, you need an [Authlete Account](https://console.authlete.com/). An Authlete account is free for up to 30 days. You can use a social login, or login using a traditional email/password.

## Step 2: Create an Organization

1. **Log in** to the [Authlete Console](https://console.authlete.com/).
1. **Create a new organization** named `acme`.

## Step 3: Create a Service

1. **Switch** to your newly created `acme` organization.
1. **Create a new service** with a name like `Demo AS`, under this organization.
1. **Keep all settings as default** for now.
1. Click **Create**. Make sure to **note down the Service ID** for use in Step 5.

## Step 4: Generate a Service Access Token

1. Go to **Service Settings** and select **Basic Settings**.
1. Open the **Advanced** tab.
1. In the **Access Tokens** section, enter a name like `Demo AS`.
1. Click **Create** to generate the token. Make sure to **copy the token** for use in Step 5.

## Step 5: Set Up Demo AS

1. **Clone** the Authlete Java OAuth Server repository, one of several reference authorization server implementations [available on GitHub](https://github.com/authlete):
git clone https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server.git
cd java-oauth-server
1. **Configure** the `authlete.properties` file to connect the authorization server to the Authlete service created in the Step 3.

Replace `&lt;&lt;Service_ID&gt;&gt;` with the Service ID from Step 3.
Replace `&lt;&lt;SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&gt;` with the Access Token from Step 4.
Adjust the `base_url` according to your api cluster region:

`base_url = https://&lt;&lt;api-cluster-region&gt;&gt;.authlete.com`

api_version = V3
base_url = https://us.authlete.com
service.api_key = &lt;&lt;Service_ID&gt;&gt;
service.access_token = &lt;&lt;SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&gt;

The `authlete.properties` file includes commented values for Authlete properties that will not be processed by default. Be sure to uncomment Authlete property values before running the server.
1. **Run the server** using either Docker (recommended) or Java:

**Using Docker** (preferred):
Use the following command to start the server:
docker compose up

**Using Java**:
Ensure that you have Maven installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly. Then, run the following command:
mvn jetty:run

**Clone** the Authlete Java OAuth Server repository, one of several reference authorization server implementations [available on GitHub](https://github.com/authlete):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server.git
cd java-oauth-server

```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server.git
cd java-oauth-server

```

**Configure** the `authlete.properties` file to connect the authorization server to the Authlete service created in the Step 3.

- Replace `&lt;&lt;Service_ID&gt;&gt;` with the Service ID from Step 3.
- Replace `&lt;&lt;SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN&gt;&gt;` with the Access Token from Step 4.
- Adjust the `base_url` according to your api cluster region:

`base_url = https://&lt;&lt;api-cluster-region&gt;&gt;.authlete.com`

- `base_url = https://&lt;&lt;api-cluster-region&gt;&gt;.authlete.com`

```properties
api_version = V3
base_url = https://us.authlete.com
service.api_key = {\`<{\`<\`}Service_ID>>\`}
service.access_token = {\`<{\`<\`}SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN>>\`}

```

```properties
api_version = V3
base_url = https://us.authlete.com
service.api_key = {\`<{\`<\`}Service_ID>>\`}
service.access_token = {\`<{\`<\`}SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN>>\`}

```

- The `authlete.properties` file includes commented values for Authlete properties that will not be processed by default. Be sure to uncomment Authlete property values before running the server.

**Run the server** using either Docker (recommended) or Java:

- **Using Docker** (preferred):
Use the following command to start the server:
docker compose up
- **Using Java**:
Ensure that you have Maven installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly. Then, run the following command:
mvn jetty:run

**Using Docker** (preferred):

Use the following command to start the server:

```bash
docker compose up

```

```bash
docker compose up

```

**Using Java**:

Ensure that you have Maven installed and `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly. Then, run the following command:

```bash
mvn jetty:run

```

```bash
mvn jetty:run

```

## Step 6: Verify the Setup

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
1. You should see the home page of the Demo authorization server.

## Step 7: Create a Client

1. To test the authorization server, you need to create a client in the Authlete Console.
1. Navigate to your **Demo AS** within the Authlete Console.
1. Click **Create Client**, enter a descriptive name for the client, and click **Create**.
1. Note down the **Client ID** for later use.
1. Go to **Endpoints -&gt; Global Settings -&gt; Redirect URIs** and click **Add URI**. Add the following Redirect URI:

`https://oidcdebugger.com/debug`
1. Leave all other settings as default and click **Save Changes**.

## Step 8: Test Your Authorization Server

### OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow

1. Visit [OpenID Connect Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/) and provide the following details:

**Authorize URI**: `http://localhost:8080/api/authorization`
**Client ID**: Enter the Client ID you copied from Step 6.
1. Set the **Response type** to `code` and **Response mode** to `form_post`.
1. (Optional) To test PKCE, select the **Use PKCE** checkbox. PKCE is enabled by default on your Authlete Service.
1. Scroll down and click the **Send Request** button to start the authorization process.

This will redirect you to the login page of the Demo AS. Enter the following credentials and click **Authorize**:

- **Login ID**: `max`
- **Password**: `max`

You will be redirected back to the OIDC Debugger with an Authorization Code issued by Authlete.

### Issue an ID Token (Implicit Flow)

1. Click **Start over** to return to the home page.
1. Set the **Response type** to `id_token`.
1. Click **Send Request** to initiate a new authorization process.
1. You will be redirected back to the debugger with a JWT ID Token issued by Authlete.

Click **Start over** to return to the home page.

Set the **Response type** to `id_token`.

Click **Send Request** to initiate a new authorization process.

You will be redirected back to the debugger with a JWT ID Token issued by Authlete.

> **Security Note:** ⚠️ For this demo setup, the ID Token is signed using the `client_secret` and the `HS256` algorithm. This configuration is intended for demo purposes only. For real-world applications, you should **upload your JSON Web Key (JWK)** and use an asymmetric signing algorithm like `RS256`.
