# API Models

This page contains the data models and schemas used throughout the Authlete API. These models define the structure of requests, responses, and data objects.

*This page is automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification.*

## Core Models

### Client

The Client model represents an OAuth 2.0 client application.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml Client Schema
Client:
  type: object
  properties:
    number:
      type: integer
      description: The sequential number of the client. The value of this property is assigned by Authlete.
      format: int32
    serviceNumber:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The sequential number of the service of the client application. The value of this property is
        assigned by Authlete.
      format: int32
    clientName:
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the client application. This property corresponds to `client_name` in
        [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0, 2. Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata).
    clientNames:
      type: array
      description: |
        Client names with language tags. If the client application has different names for different
        languages, this property can be used to register the names.
      items:
        type: object
    description:
      type: string
      description: The description about the client application.
    descriptions:
      type: array
      description: |
        Descriptions about the client application with language tags. If the client application has different
        descriptions for different languages, this property can be used to register the descriptions.
      items:
        type: object
    clientId:
      type: integer
      description: The client identifier used in Authlete API calls. The value of this property is assigned by Authlete.
      format: int64
    clientSecret:
      type: string
      description: |
        The client secret. A random 512-bit value encoded by base64url (86 letters). The value of this
        property is assigned by Authlete.
        
        Note that Authlete issues a client secret even to a "public" client application, but the client
        application should not use the client secret unless it changes its client type to "confidential".
        That is, a public client application should behave as if it had not been issued a client secret.
        To be specific, a token request from a public client of Authlete should not come along with a
        client secret although [RFC 6749, 3.2.1. Client Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2.1)
        says as follows.
        
        > Confidential clients or other clients issued client credentials MUST authenticate with the
        authorization server as described in Section 2.3 when making requests to the token endpoint.
    clientIdAlias:
      type: string
      description: |
        The value of the client's `client_id` property used in OAuth and OpenID Connect calls. By

    redirectUris:
      type: array
      description: |
        Redirect URIs that the client application uses to receive a response from the authorization endpoint.
        Requirements for a redirect URI are as follows.
        
        **Requirements by RFC 6749** (From [RFC 6749, 3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2))
        
        - Must be an absolute URI.
        - Must not have a fragment component.
        
        **Requirements by OpenID Connect** (From "[OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0, 2.
        Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata),
        application_type")
        
        - The scheme of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
        is `web` must be `https`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
        - The hostname of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
        type is `web` must not be `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
        - The scheme of the redirect URI used by a client application whose application type is `native`
        must be either (1) a custom scheme or (2) `http`, which is allowed only when the hostname part
        is `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
        
        **Requirements by Authlete**
        
        - Must consist of printable ASCII letters only.
        - Must not exceed 200 letters.
        
        Note that Authlete allows the application type to be `null`. In other words, a client application
        does not have to choose `web` or `native` as its application type.
        If the application type is `null`, the requirements by OpenID Connect are not checked at runtime.
        
        An authorization request from a client application which has not registered any redirect URI
        fails unless at least all the following conditions are satisfied.
        
        - The client type of the client application is `confidential`.
        - The value of `response_type` request parameter is `code`.
        - The authorization request has the `redirect_uri` request parameter.
        - The value of `scope` request parameter does not contain `openid`.
        
        RFC 6749 allows partial match of redirect URI under some conditions (see [RFC 6749, 3.1.2.2.
        Registration Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.2) for
        details), but OpenID Connect requires exact match.

        Standard client metadata included in Client Registration Request and Client Update Request (cf.
        [OIDC DynReg](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html), [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html)
        and [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)) are, if supported by Authlete, set
        to corresponding properties of the client application. For example, the value of the `client_name`
        client metadata in Client Registration/Update Request is set to the clientName property. On the

        custom client metadata values can be referenced by this property.
    frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired:

      description: |
        The flag indicating whether encryption of request object is required when the request object
        is passed through the front channel.
        
        This flag does not affect the processing of request objects at the Pushed Authorization Request
        Endpoint, which is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9126/).
        Unecrypted request objects are accepted at the endpoint even if this flag is `true`.
        
        This flag does not indicate whether a request object is always required. There is a different
        flag, `requestObjectRequired`, for the purpose.
        
        Even if this flag is `false`, encryption of request object is required if the `frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired`
        flag of the service is `true`.
    requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the JWE alg of encrypted request object must match the `request_object_encryption_alg`

        The `request_object_encryption_alg` client metadata itself is defined in [OpenID Connect Dynamic
        Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) as follows.
        
        > request_object_encryption_alg
        >
        > OPTIONAL. JWE [JWE] alg algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request
          Objects sent to the OP. This parameter SHOULD be included when symmetric encryption will be used,
          since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the
          symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP MAY still use other
          supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter
          is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed
          then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. The default, if omitted,
          is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.
        
        The point here is "The RP MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted
        Request Objects, even when this parameter is present."
        
        The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionAlg`. See the description
        of `requestEncryptionAlg` for details.
        
        Even if this flag is `false`, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired`
        flag of the service is `true`.

      type: boolean
      description: |

        > request_object_encryption_enc
        >
        > OPTIONAL. JWE enc algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request
          Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this
          value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg
          MUST also be provided.
        
        The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionEnc`. See the description
        of `requestEncryptionEnc`  for details.
        
        Even if this flag is `false`, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionEncMatchRequired`
        flag of the service is `true`.

    singleAccessTokenPerSubject:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If `Enabled` is selected, an attempt to issue a new access token invalidates existing access tokens that are associated with the same combination of subject and client.
        
        Note that, however, attempts by Client Credentials Flow do not invalidate existing access tokens because access tokens issued by Client Credentials Flow are not associated with any end-user's subject.
        
        Even if `Disabled` is selected here, single access token per subject is effective if `singleAccessTokenPerSubject` of the `Service` this client belongs to is Enabled.

        [OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lodderstedt-oauth-par)
        defines an endpoint (called "pushed authorization request endpoint") which client applications
        can register authorization requests into and get corresponding URIs (called "request URIs") from.
        The issued URIs represent the registered authorization requests. The client applications can use
        the URIs as the value of the `request_uri` request parameter in an authorization request.
        
        The property represents the duration of registered authorization requests and is used as the value
        of the `expires_in` parameter in responses from the pushed authorization request endpoint.

        If this flag is set to `true` and the value of `traditionalRequestObjectProcessingApplied` is
        `false`, the value of `require_signed_request_object` server metadata of this service is reported
        as `true` in the discovery document. The metadata is defined in JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request).
        That `require_signed_request_object` is `true` means that authorization requests which don't
        conform to the JAR specification are rejected.
    traditionalRequestObjectProcessingApplied:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag to indicate whether a request object is processed based on rules defined in
        [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) or JAR (JWT
        Secured Authorization Request).
        
        Differences between rules in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 and ones in JAR are as follows.
          - JAR requires that a request object be always -signed.
          - JAR does not allow request parameters outside a request object to be referred to.
          - OIDC Core 1.0 requires that response_type request parameter exist outside a request object even if the request object includes the request parameter.
          - OIDC Core 1.0 requires that scope request parameter exist outside a request object if the authorization request is an
          - OIDC request even if the request object includes the request parameter.
        
        If this flag is set to `false` and the value of `requestObjectRequired` is `true`, the value of
        `require_signed_request_object` server metadata of this service
        is reported as `true` in the discovery document. The metadata is defined in JAR (JWT Secured
        Authorization Request). That `require_signed_request_object` is `true` means that authorization
        requests which don't conform to the JAR specification are rejected.

        This value is used as the value of `token_type` property in access token responses. If this service
        complies with [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750), the value of this property should
        be `Bearer`.

        The flag to indicate whether the number of access tokens per subject (and per client) is at most one or can be more.
        
        If `true`, an attempt to issue a new access token invalidates existing access tokens that are associated with the same subject and the same client.
        
        Note that, however, attempts by [Client Credentials Flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) do not invalidate existing access tokens because access tokens issued by Client Credentials Flow are not associated with any end-user's subject. Also note that an attempt by [Refresh Token Flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6) invalidates the coupled access token only and this invalidation is always performed regardless of whether the value of this setting item is `true` or `false`.

        The signature algorithm for JWT. This value is represented on 'alg' attribute
        of the header of JWT.
        
        it's semantics depends upon where is this defined, for instance:
          - as service accessTokenSignAlg value, it defines that access token are JWT and the algorithm used to sign it. Check your [KB article](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/jwt-based-access-token).
          - as client authorizationSignAlg value, it represents the signature algorithm used when [creating a JARM response](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/enabling-jarm).
          - or as client requestSignAlg value, it specifies which is the expected signature used by [client on a Request Object](https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/request-objects).

      description: |
        The key ID to identify a JWK used for signing access tokens.
        
        A JWK Set can be registered as a property of a service. A JWK Set can contain 0 or more JWKs.
        Authlete Server has to pick up one JWK for signing from the JWK Set when it generates a JWT-based
        access token. Authlete Server searches the registered JWK Set for a JWK which satisfies conditions
        for access token signature. If the number of JWK candidates which satisfy the conditions is 1,
        there is no problem. On the other hand, if there exist multiple candidates, a Key ID is needed
        to be specified so that Authlete Server can pick up one JWK from among the JWK candidates.
    refreshTokenDuration:

        if the `refreshTokenKept` property of this service set to is `true` (= even if "Refresh Token
        Continuous Use" is "Kept").
        
        This flag has no effect when the `refreshTokenKept` property is set to `false`. In other words,
        if this service issues a new refresh token on every refresh token request, the refresh token
        will have fresh duration (unless `refreshTokenDurationKept` is set to `true`) and this
        `refreshTokenDurationReset` property is not referenced.
    refreshTokenKept:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag to indicate whether a refresh token remains unchanged or gets renewed after its use.
        
        If `true`, a refresh token used to get a new access token remains valid after its use. Otherwise, if `false`, a refresh token is invalidated after its use and a new refresh token is issued.
        
        See [RFC 6749 6. Refreshing an Access Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6), as to how to get a new access token using a refresh token.

        | Name | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | openid | A permission to get an ID token of an end-user. The `openid` scope appears in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request, scope](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest). Without this scope, Authlete does not allow `response_type` request parameter to have values other than code and token. |

See [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) for details. |
        | email | A permission to get information about `email` and `email_verified` from the user info endpoint. See [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) for details. |
        | address | A permission to get information about address from the user info endpoint. See [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) and [5.1.1. Address Claim](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AddressClaim) for details. |
        | phone | A permission to get information about `phone_number` and `phone_number_verified` from the user info endpoint. See [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) for details. |

    scopeRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag to indicate whether requests that request no scope are rejected or not.
        
        When a request has no explicit `scope` parameter and the service's pre-defined default scope set is empty,
        the authorization server regards the request requests no scope. When this flag is set to `true`,
        requests that request no scope are rejected.
        
        The requirement below excerpted from [RFC 6749 Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3)
        does not explicitly mention the case where the default scope set is empty.
        
        > If the client omits the scope parameter when requesting authorization, the authorization server
        MUST either process the request using a pre-defined default value or fail the request indicating an invalid scope.
        
        However, if you interpret *"the default scope set exists but is empty"* as *"the default scope set does not exist"*
        and want to strictly conform to the requirement above, this flag has to be `true`.

        Backchannel token delivery modes are defined in the specification of [CIBA (Client Initiated
        Backchannel Authentication)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html).
    backchannelAuthReqIdDuration:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The duration of backchannel authentication request IDs issued from the backchannel authentication
        endpoint in seconds. This is used as the value of the `expires_in` property in responses from
        the backchannel authentication endpoint.
      format: int32
    backchannelPollingInterval:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The minimum interval between polling requests to the token endpoint from client applications in
        seconds. This is used as the value of the `interval` property in responses from the backchannel
        authentication endpoint.
      format: int32
    backchannelUserCodeParameterSupported:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The boolean flag which indicates whether the `user_code` request parameter is supported at the
        backchannel authentication endpoint. This property corresponds to the `backchannel_user_code_parameter_supported`
        metadata.
    backchannelBindingMessageRequiredInFapi:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag to indicate whether the `binding_message` request parameter is always required whenever
        a backchannel authentication request is judged as a request for Financial-grade API.
        
        The FAPI-CIBA profile requires that the authorization server _"shall ensure unique authorization
        context exists in the authorization request or require a `binding_message` in the authorization
        request"_ (FAPI-CIBA, 5.2.2, 2). The simplest way to fulfill this requirement is to set this property
        to `true`.
        
        If this property is set to `false`, the `binding_message` request parameter remains optional
        even in FAPI context, but in exchange, your authorization server must implement a custom mechanism
        that ensures each backchannel authentication request has unique context.
    deviceAuthorizationEndpoint:
      type: string
      description: |
        The URI of the device authorization endpoint.
        
        Device authorization endpoint is defined in the specification of OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant.
      format: uri
    deviceVerificationUri:
      type: string
      description: |
        The verification URI for the device flow. This URI is used as the value of the `verification_uri`
        parameter in responses from the device authorization endpoint.
      format: uri
    deviceVerificationUriComplete:
      type: string
      description: |
        The verification URI for the device flow with a placeholder for a user code. This URI is used
        to build the value of the `verification_uri_complete` parameter in responses from the device
        authorization endpoint.
        
        It is expected that the URI contains a fixed string `USER_CODE` somewhere as a placeholder for
        a user code. For example, like the following.
        
        `https://example.com/device?user\_code=USER\_CODE`
        
        The fixed string is replaced with an actual user code when Authlete builds a verification URI
        with a user code for the `verification_uri_complete` parameter.
        
        If this URI is not set, the `verification_uri_complete` parameter won't appear in device authorization
        responses.
      format: uri

    nbfOptional:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the nbf claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization
        request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request.
        
        The final version of Financial-grade API was approved in January, 2021. The Part 2 of the final
        version has new requirements on lifetime of request objects. They require that request objects
        contain an `nbf` claim and the lifetime computed by `exp` - `nbf` be no longer than 60 minutes.
        
        Therefore, when an authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request, the request object
        used in the authorization request must contain an nbf claim. Otherwise, the authorization server
        rejects the authorization request.
        
        When this flag is `true`, the `nbf` claim is treated as an optional claim even when the authorization
        request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. That is, the authorization server does not perform
        the validation on lifetime of the request object.
        
        Skipping the validation is a violation of the FAPI specification. The reason why this flag has
        been prepared nevertheless is that the new requirements (which do not exist in the Implementer's
        Draft 2 released in October, 2018) have big impacts on deployed implementations of client
        applications and Authlete thinks there should be a mechanism whereby to make the migration
        from ID2 to Final smooth without breaking live systems.
    issSuppressed:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether generation of the iss response parameter is suppressed.
        
        "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identifier in Authorization Response" has defined a new
        authorization response parameter, `iss`, as a countermeasure for a certain type of mix-up attacks.
        
        The specification requires that the `iss` response parameter always be included in authorization
        responses unless JARM (JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode) is used.
        
        When this flag is `true`, the authorization server does not include the `iss` response parameter
        in authorization responses. By turning this flag on and off, developers of client applications
        can experiment the mix-up attack and the effect of the `iss` response parameter.
        
        Note that this flag should not be `true` in production environment unless there are special
        reasons for it.
    supportedCustomClientMetadata:
      type: array
      description: |
        custom client metadata supported by this service.

        Standard client metadata included in Client Registration Request and Client Update Request (cf.
        [OIDC DynReg](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html), [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html)
        and [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)) are, if supported by Authlete, stored
        into Authlete database. On the other hand, unrecognized client metadata are discarded.
        
        By listing up custom client metadata in advance by using this property (`supportedCustomClientMetadata`),
        Authlete can recognize them and stores their values into the database. The stored custom client
        metadata values can be referenced by `customMetadata`.

    tokenExpirationLinked:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the expiration date of an access token never exceeds that of the
        corresponding refresh token.
        
        When a new access token is issued by a refresh token request (= a token request with `grant_type=refresh_token`),
        the expiration date of the access token may exceed the expiration date of the corresponding
        refresh token. This behavior itself is not wrong and may happen when `refreshTokenKept` is
        `true` and/or when `refreshTokenDurationKept` is `true`.
        
        When this flag is `true`, the expiration date of an access token never exceeds that of the corresponding
        refresh token regardless of the calculated duration based on other settings such as `accessTokenDuration`,
        `accessTokenDuration` in `extension` and `access_token.duration` scope attribute.
        
        It is technically possible to set a value which is bigger than the duration of refresh tokens
        as the duration of access tokens although it is strange. In the case, the duration of an access
        token becomes longer than the duration of the refresh token which is issued together with the
        access token. Even if the duration values are configured so, if this flag is `true`, the expiration
        date of the access token does not exceed that of the refresh token. That is, the duration of
        the access token will be shortened, and as a result, the access token and the refresh token
        will have the same expiration date.
    frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether encryption of request object is required when the request object
        is passed through the front channel.
        
        This flag does not affect the processing of request objects at the Pushed Authorization Request
        Endpoint, which is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9126/).
        Unecrypted request objects are accepted at the endpoint even if this flag is `true`.
        
        This flag does not indicate whether a request object is always required. There is a different
        flag, `requestObjectRequired`, for the purpose. See the description of `requestObjectRequired`
        for details.
        
        Even if this flag is `false`, encryption of request object is required if the `frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired`
        flag of the client is `true`.
    requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the JWE alg of encrypted request object must match the `request_object_encryption_alg`
        client metadata of the client that has sent the request object.
        
        The request_object_encryption_alg client metadata itself is defined in [OpenID Connect Dynamic
        Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) as follows.
        
        > request_object_encryption_alg
        >
        > OPTIONAL. JWE [JWE] alg algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting
        Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter SHOULD be included when symmetric encryption
        will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned
        from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP
        MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even
        when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object
        will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. The
        default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.
        
        The point here is "The RP MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted
        Request Objects, even when this parameter is present."
        
        The Client's property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionAlg`. See the
        description of `requestEncryptionAlg` for details.
        
        Even if this flag is `false`, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired`
        flag of the client is `true`.
    requestObjectEncryptionEncMatchRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the JWE `enc` of encrypted request object must match the `request_object_encryption_enc`
        client metadata of the client that has sent the request object.
        
        The `request_object_encryption_enc` client metadata itself is defined in [OpenID Connect Dynamic
        Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) as follows.
        
        > request_object_encryption_enc
        >
        > OPTIONAL. JWE enc algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request
        Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this
        value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg
        MUST also be provided.
        
        The Client's property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionEnc`. See the
        description of `requestEncryptionEnc` for details.
        
        Even if this flag is false, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionEncMatchRequired`
        flag is `true`.
    hsmEnabled:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether HSM (Hardware Security Module) support is enabled for this service.
        
        When this flag is `false`, keys managed in HSMs are not used even if they exist. In addition,
        `/api/hsk/*` APIs reject all requests.
        
        Even if this flag is `true`, HSM-related features do not work if the configuration of the Authlete
        server you are using does not support HSM.
    hsks:
      type: array
      description: |
        The information about keys managed on HSMs (Hardware Security Modules).
        
        This `hsks` property is output only, meaning that `hsks` in requests to `/api/service/create`
        API and `/api/service/update` API do not have any effect. The contents of this property is controlled
        only by `/api/hsk/*` APIs.

    grantManagementActionRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether every authorization request (and any request serving as an authorization
        request such as CIBA backchannel authentication request and device authorization request) must
        include the `grant_management_action` request parameter.
        
        This property corresponds to the `grant_management_action_required` server metadata defined
        in [Grant Management for OAuth 2.0](https://openid.net/specs/fapi-grant-management.html).
        
        Note that setting true to this property will result in blocking all public clients because
        the specification requires that grant management be usable only by confidential clients for
        security reasons.
    unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether Authlete's `/api/client/registration` API uses `UNAUTHORIZED` as
        a value of the `action` response parameter when appropriate.
        
        The `UNAUTHORIZED` enum value was initially not defined as a possible value of the `action`
        parameter in an `/api/client/registration` API response. This means that implementations of
        client `configuration` endpoint were not able to conform to [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)
        strictly.
        
        For backward compatibility (to avoid breaking running systems), Authlete's `/api/client/registration`
        API does not return the `UNAUTHORIZED` enum value if this flag is not turned on.
        
        The steps an existing implementation of client configuration endpoint has to do in order to
        conform to the requirement related to "401 Unauthorized" are as follows.
        
        1. Update the Authlete library (e.g. authlete-java-common) your system is using.
        2. Update your implementation of client configuration endpoint so that it can handle the
        `UNAUTHORIZED` action.
        3. Turn on this `unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` flag.
    dcrScopeUsedAsRequestable:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the `scope` request parameter in dynamic client registration and
        update requests (RFC 7591 and RFC 7592) is used as scopes that the client can request.
        
        Limiting the range of scopes that a client can request is achieved by listing scopes in the
        `client.extension.requestableScopes` property and setting the `client.extension.requestableScopesEnabled`
        property to `true`. This feature is called "requestable scopes".
        
        This property affects behaviors of `/api/client/registration` and other family APIs.
    endSessionEndpoint:
      type: string
      description: |
        The endpoint for clients ending the sessions.
        
        A URL that starts with `https://` and has no fragment component. For example, `https://example.com/auth/endSession`.
        
        The value of this property is used as `end_session_endpoint` property in the [OpenID Provider
        Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata).
      format: uri
    loopbackRedirectionUriVariable:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the port number component of redirection URIs can be variable when
        the host component indicates loopback.
        
        When this flag is `true`, if the host component of a redirection URI specified in an authorization
        request indicates loopback (to be precise, when the host component is localhost, `127.0.0.1`
        or `::1`), the port number component is ignored when the specified redirection URI is compared
        to pre-registered ones. This behavior is described in [7.3. Loopback Interface Redirection](
        https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html#section-7.3) of [RFC 8252 OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html)
        for Native Apps.
        
        [3.1.2.3. Dynamic Configuration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-3.1.2.3)
        of [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) states _"If the client registration
        included the full redirection URI, the authorization server MUST compare the two URIs using
        simple string comparison as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6.2.1."_ Also, the description of
        `redirect_uri` in [3.1.2.1. Authentication Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)
        of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) states
        _"This URI MUST exactly match one of the Redirection URI values for the Client pre-registered
        at the OpenID Provider, with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986]
        (**Simple String Comparison**)."_ These "Simple String Comparison" requirements are preceded
        by this flag. That is, even when the conditions described in RFC 6749 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0
        are satisfied, the port number component of loopback redirection URIs can be variable when this
        flag is `true`.
        
        [8.3. Loopback Redirect Considerations](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html#section-8.3)
        of [RFC 8252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html) states as follows.
        
        > While redirect URIs using localhost (i.e., `"http://localhost:{port}/{path}"`) function
        similarly to loopback IP redirects described in Section 7.3, the use of localhost is NOT RECOMMENDED.
        Specifying a redirect URI with the loopback IP literal rather than localhost avoids inadvertently
        listening on network interfaces other than the loopback interface. It is also less susceptible
        to client-side firewalls and misconfigured host name resolution on the user's device.
        
        However, Authlete allows the port number component to be variable in the case of `localhost`,
        too. It is left to client applications whether they use `localhost` or a literal loopback IP
        address (`127.0.0.1` for IPv4 or `::1` for IPv6).
        
        Section 7.3 and Section 8.3 of [RFC 8252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html) state
        that loopback redirection URIs use the `"http"` scheme, but Authlete allows the port number
        component to be variable in other cases (e.g. in the case of the `"https"` scheme), too.
    requestObjectAudienceChecked:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether Authlete checks whether the `aud` claim of request objects matches
        the issuer identifier of this service.
        
        [Section 6.1. Passing a Request Object by Value](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests)
        of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) has the following
        statement.
        
        > The `aud` value SHOULD be or include the OP's Issuer Identifier URL.
        
        Likewise, [Section 4. Request Object](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html#section-4) of
        [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) (The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework:
        JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)) has the following statement.
        
        > The value of aud should be the value of the authorization server (AS) issuer, as defined in
        [RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html).
        
        As excerpted above, validation on the `aud` claim of request objects is optional. However, if
        this flag is turned on, Authlete checks whether the `aud` claim of request objects matches the issuer
        identifier of this service and raises an error if they are different.

        token in. In other cases, this request parameter is ignored.
      format: int64
    sessionId:
      type: string
      description: |
        The session ID of the user's authentication session. The specified value will be embedded in the
        ID token as the value of the `sid` claim. This parameter needs to be provided only if you want
        to support the [OpenID Connect Native SSO for Mobile Apps 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html)
        specification (a.k.a. "Native SSO"). To enable support for the Native SSO specification, the
        `nativeSsoSupported` property of your service must be set to `true`.
        
        NOTE: When the response from the `/auth/authorization` API contains the `nativeSsoRequested`
        property with a value of `true`, the `sessionId` request parameter must be provided to the
        `/auth/authorization/issue` API.
    idTokenAudType:
      type: string
      description: |
        The type of the `aud` claim of the ID token being issued. Valid values are as follows.
        
        | Value | Description |
        | ----- | ----------- |
        | "array" | The type of the aud claim is always an array of strings. |
        | "string" | The type of the aud claim is always a single string. |
        | null | The type of the aud claim remains the same as before. |
        
        This request parameter takes precedence over the `idTokenAudType` property of the service.
    verifiedClaimsForTx:
      type: string
      description: |
        Values of verified claims requested indirectly by "transformed claims".
        
        A client application may request "transformed claims". Each of transformed claims uses an existing
        claim as input. As a result, to compute the value of a transformed claim, the value of the referenced
        existing claim is needed. This `verifiedClaimsForTx` request parameter has to be used to provide
        values of existing claims for computation of transformed claims.
        
        A response from the `/auth/authorization` API may include the `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx` response
        parameter which is a list of verified claims that are referenced indirectly by transformed claims
        (cf. `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx` in `/auth/authorization` API response). The authorization
        server implementation should prepare values of the verified claims listed in `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx`
        and pass them as the value of this `verifiedClaimsForTx` request parameter.
        
        The following is an example of the value of this request parameter.
        
        ```
        [
          "{\"birthdate\":\"1970-01-23\",\"nationalities\":[\"DEU\",\"USA\"]}"
        ]
        ```
        
        The reason that this `verifiedClaimsForTx` property is an array is that the `"verified_claims"`
        property in the claims request parameter of an authorization request can be an array like below.
        
        ```
        {
          "transformed_claims": {
            "nationality_usa": {
              "claim": "nationalities",
              "fn": [
                [ "eq", "USA" ],
                "any"
              ]
            }
          },
          "id_token": {
            "verified_claims": [

        See [OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop)
        for details.
    uri:
      type: string
      description: The full URL of the userinfo endpoint.
    message:
      type: string
      description: The HTTP message body of the request, if present.
    headers:
      type: array
      description: |
        HTTP headers to be included in processing the signature. If this is a signed request, this must include the
        Signature and Signature-Input headers, as well as any additional headers covered by the signature.
    targetUri:
      type: string
      description: |
        The target URI of the userinfo request, including the query part, if any.
        
        This parameter is used as the value of the `@target-uri` derived component for HTTP message signatures
        ([RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, Section 2.2.2. Target URI](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html#section-2.2.2)).
        Additionally, other derived components such as `@authority`, `@scheme`, `@path`, `@query` and
        `@query-param` are computed from this parameter.
        
        When this parameter is omitted, the value of the `htu` parameter is used. The `htu` parameter
        represents the URL of the userinfo endpoint, which usually serves as the target URI of the userinfo request.
        The only exception is when the access token is specified as a query parameter, as defined in
        [RFC 6750 Section 2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html#section-2.3). However, RFC 6750
        states that this method "SHOULD NOT be used" unless other methods are not viable.
        
        If neither this `targetUri` parameter nor the `htu` parameter is specified, the `userInfoEndpoint`
        property of the service is used as a fallback.
    dpopNonceRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether to check if the DPoP proof JWT includes the expected `nonce` value.
        
        If this request parameter is set to `true` or if the service's `dpopNonceRequired` property is
        set to `true`, the `/auth/userinfo` API checks if the DPoP proof JWT includes the expected `nonce`
        value. In this case, the response from the `/auth/userinfo` API will include the `dpopNonce` response
        parameter, which should be used as the value of the DPoP-Nonce HTTP header.
    requestBodyContained:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the userinfo request contains a request body.
        
        When the userinfo request must comply with the HTTP message signing requirements defined in the
        FAPI 2.0 Message Signing specification, the `"content-digest"` component identifier must be included
        in the signature base of the HTTP message signature (see [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html))
        if the userinfo request contains a request body.
        
        When this `requestBodyContained` parameter is set to `true`, Authlete checks whether `"content-digest"`
        is included in the signature base, if the FAPI profile applies to the userinfo request.
        
        NOTE: The FAPI 2.0 Message Signing specification is not applied to the userinfo endpoint until
        its necessity is agreed upon by the industry (cf. [FAPI Issue 723](https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/723)).

    targetUri:
      type: string
      description: |
        The target URI of the resource request, including the query part, if any.
        
        This parameter is used as the value of the @target-uri derived component for HTTP message signatures
        [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, Section 2.2.2. Target URI](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html#section-2.2.2)).
        Additionally, other derived components such as `@authority`, `@scheme`, `@path`, `@query` and
        `@query-param` are computed from this parameter.
        
        When this parameter is omitted, the value of the `htu` parameter is used. The `htu` parameter
        represents the URL of the resource endpoint, which is identical to the target URI of the resource
        request as long as the request does not include a query component. Conversely, if the resource
        request includes a query component, the value of the `htu` parameter will not match the target
        URI, and in that case, the HTTP message signature verification will fail.
        
        If neither this `targetUri` parameter nor the `htu` parameter is specified, the target URI is
        considered unavailable. If HTTP message signing requires the target-uri derived component or
        other derived components computed based on the target URI, the HTTP message signature verification
        will fail.
    dpopNonceRequired:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether to check if the DPoP proof JWT includes the expected `nonce` value.
        
        If this request parameter is set to `true` or if the service's `dpopNonceRequired` property is
        set to `true`, the `/auth/introspection` API checks if the DPoP proof JWT includes the expected
        `nonce` value. In this case, the response from the `/auth/introspection` API will include the
        `dpopNonce` response parameter, which should be used as the value of the DPoP-Nonce HTTP header.
    requestBodyContained:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        The flag indicating whether the resource request contains a request body.
        
        When the resource request must comply with the HTTP message signing requirements defined in the
        FAPI 2.0 Message Signing specification, the `"content-digest"` component identifier must be included
        in the signature base of the HTTP message signature (see [RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html))
        if the resource request contains a request body.
        
        When this `requestBodyContained` parameter is set to `true`, Authlete checks whether `"content-digest"`
        is included in the signature base, if the FAPI profile applies to the resource request.

      description: |
        The subject (= unique identifier) of the user who will be associated with a newly created access
        token. This parameter is required unless the grant type is `CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`. The value must
        consist of only ASCII characters and its length must not exceed 100.

        Extra properties to associate with a newly created access token. Note that properties parameter
        is accepted only when the HTTP method of the request is POST and Content-Type of the request is
        `application/json`, so don't use `GET` method or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` if you want
        to specify properties.
      items:
        type: object
    clientIdAliasUsed:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        A boolean request parameter which indicates whether to emulate that the client ID alias is used
        instead of the original numeric client ID when a new access token is created.
        
        This has an effect only on the value of the aud claim in a response from [UserInfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).
        When you access the UserInfo endpoint (which is expected to be implemented using Authlete's
        `/api/auth/userinfo` API and `/api/auth/userinfo/issue` API) with an access token which has been
        created using Authlete's `/api/auth/token/create` API with this property (`clientIdAliasUsed`)
        `true`, the client ID alias is used as the value of the aud claim in a response from the UserInfo
        endpoint.
        
        Note that if a client ID alias is not assigned to the client when Authlete's `/api/auth/token/create`
        API is called, this property (`clientIdAliasUsed`) has no effect (it is always regarded as `false`).
    accessToken:
      type: string
      description: |
        The value of the new access token.
        
        The `/api/auth/token/create` API generates an access token. Therefore, callers of the API do not
        have to specify values of newly created access tokens. However, in some cases, for example, if
        you want to migrate existing access tokens from an old system to Authlete, you may want to specify
        values of access tokens. In such a case, you can specify the value of a newly created access token
        by passing a non-null value as the value of accessToken request parameter. The implementation
        of the `/api/auth/token/create` uses the value of the accessToken request parameter instead of
        generating a new value when the request parameter holds a non-null value.
        
        Note that if the hash value of the specified access token already exists in Authlete's database,
        the access token cannot be inserted and the `/api/auth/token/create` API will report an error.
    refreshToken:
      type: string
      description: |
        The value of the new refresh token.
        
        The `/api/auth/token/create` API may generate a refresh token. Therefore, callers of the API do
        not have to specify values of newly created refresh tokens. However, in some cases, for example,
        if you want to migrate existing refresh tokens from an old system to Authlete, you may want to
        specify values of refresh tokens. In such a case, you can specify the value of a newly created
        refresh token by passing a non-null value as the value of refreshToken request parameter. The
        implementation of the `/api/auth/token/create` uses the value of the refreshToken request parameter
        instead of generating a new value when the request parameter holds a non-null value.
        
        Note that if the hash value of the specified refresh token already exists in Authlete's database,
        the refresh token cannot be inserted and the `/api/auth/token/create` API will report an error.
    accessTokenPersistent:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Get whether the access token expires or not. By default, all access tokens expire after a period
        of time determined by their service.
        
        If this request parameter is `true`, then the access token will not automatically expire and must
        be revoked or deleted manually at the service. If this request parameter is true, the `accessTokenDuration`
        request parameter is ignored.
    certificateThumbprint:
      type: string
      description: |
        The thumbprint of the MTLS certificate bound to this token. If this property is set, a certificate
        with the corresponding value MUST be presented with the access token when it is used by a client.
        The value of this property must be a SHA256 certificate thumbprint, base64url encoded.
    dpopKeyThumbprint:
      type: string
      description: |
        The thumbprint of the public key used for DPoP presentation of this token. If this property is
        set, a DPoP proof signed with the corresponding private key MUST be presented with the access
        token when it is used by a client. Additionally, the token's `token_type` will be set to 'DPoP'.
    authorizationDetails:
      type: object
      description: |
        The authorization details. This represents the value of the `authorization_details`
        request parameter in the preceding device authorization request which is defined in
        "OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests".
    resources:
      type: array
      description: |
        The value of the resources to associate with the token. This property represents the value of
        one or more `resource` request parameters which is defined in "RFC8707 Resource Indicators for
        OAuth 2.0".
      items:

### TokenIntrospectionRequest

Request model for tokenintrospection operations.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml TokenIntrospectionRequest Schema
TokenIntrospectionRequest:
  type: object
  required:
    - parameters
  properties:
    parameters: # Required
      type: string
      description: |
        Request parameters which comply with the introspection request defined
        in "[2.1. Introspection Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1)" in
        RFC 7662.
        
        The implementation of the introspection endpoint of your authorization server will receive an
        HTTP POST [[RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231)] request with parameters
        in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format. It is the entity body of the request that
        Authlete's  `/api/auth/introspection/standard` API expects as the value of `parameters`.
    withHiddenProperties:
      type: string
      description: |
        Flag indicating whether to include hidden properties in the output.
        
        Authlete has a mechanism whereby to associate arbitrary key-value pairs with an access token.
        Each key-value pair has a hidden attribute. By default, key-value pairs whose hidden attribute
        is set to `true` are not embedded in the standard introspection output.
        
        If the `withHiddenProperties` request parameter is given and its value is `true`, `/api/auth/introspection/standard
        API includes all the associated key-value pairs into the output regardless of the value of the
        hidden attribute.
    rsUri:
      type: string
      description: |
        The URI of the resource server making the introspection request.
        
        If the `rsUri` request parameter is given and the token has audience values, Authlete checks if
        the value of the `rsUri` request parameter is contained in the audience values. If not contained,
        Authlete generates an introspection response with the `active` property set to `false`.
        
        The `rsUri` request parameter is required when the resource server requests a JWT introspection
        response, i.e., when the value of the `httpAcceptHeader` request parameter is set to `"application/token-introspection+jwt"`.
    httpAcceptHeader:
      type: string
      description: |
        The value of the `HTTP Accept` header in the introspection request.
        
        If the value of the `httpAcceptHeader` request parameter is `"application/token-introspection+jwt"`,
        Authlete generates a JWT introspection response. See "[4. Requesting a JWT Response](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html#section-4)"
        of "[RFC 9701: JWT Response for OAuth Token Introspection](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html)"
        for more details.
    introspectionSignAlg:
      type: string
      description: |
        The JWS `alg` algorithm for signing the introspection response. This parameter corresponds to
        `introspection_signed_response_alg` defined in "[6. Client Metadata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html#section-6)"
        of "[RFC 9701: JWT Response for OAuth Token Introspection](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html)".
        
        The default value is `RS256`.
    introspectionEncryptionAlg:
      type: string
      description: |
        The JWE `alg` algorithm for encrypting the introspection response. This parameter corresponds
        to `introspection_encrypted_response_alg` defined in "[6. Client Metadata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html#section-6)"
        of "[RFC 9701: JWT Response for OAuth Token Introspection](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html)".
        
        If the `introspectionEncryptionAlg` request parameter is specified, Authlete generates a JWT
        introspection response encrypted with the algorithm by this property and the algorithm specified by
        the `introspectionEncryptionEnc` request parameter.
    introspectionEncryptionEnc:
      type: string
      description: |
        The JWE `enc` algorithm for encrypting the introspection response. This parameter corresponds
        to `introspection_encrypted_response_enc` defined in "[6. Client Metadata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html#section-6)"
        of "[RFC 9701: JWT Response for OAuth Token Introspection](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9701.html)".
        
        The default value is `A128CBC_HS256`.
    sharedKeyForSign:
      type: string
      description: |
        The shared key for signing the introspection response with a symmetric algorithm.
        
        The `sharedKeyForSign` request parameter is required when the introspection response is requested
        to be signed with a symmetric algorithm.
    sharedKeyForEncryption:
      type: string
      description: |
        The shared key for encrypting the introspection response with a symmetric algorithm.
        
        The `sharedKeyForEncryption` request parameter is required when the introspection response is
        requested to be encrypted with a symmetric algorithm.
    publicKeyForEncryption:
      type: string
      description: |
        The public key for signing the introspection response with an asymmetric algorithm.
        
        The `publicKeyForEncryption` request parameter is required when the introspection response is
        requested to be encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm.

        the access token which was contained in the userinfo request.
    claims:
      type: string
      description: Claims in JSON format. As for the format, see [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.1. Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).
    sub:

      description: |
        The value of the `sub` claim. If the value of this request parameter is not empty, it is used as the value of
        the `sub` claim. Otherwise, the value of the subject associated with the access token is used.
    claimsForTx:
      type: string
      description: Claim key-value pairs that are used to compute transformed claims.
    requestSignature:
      type: string
      description: The Signature header value from the request.
    headers:
      type: array
      description: |
        HTTP headers to be included in processing the signature. If this is a signed request, this must include the
        Signature and Signature-Input headers, as well as any additional headers covered by the signature.
    verifiedClaimsForTx:
      type: string
      description: |
        Values of verified claims requested indirectly by "transformed claims".
        
        A client application may request "transformed claims". Each of transformed claims uses an existing
        claim as input. As a result, to compute the value of a transformed claim, the value of the referenced
        existing claim is needed. This `verifiedClaimsForTx` request parameter has to be used to provide
        values of existing claims for computation of transformed claims.
        
        A response from the `/auth/userinfo` API may include the `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx` response
        parameter which is a list of verified claims that are referenced indirectly by transformed claims
        (cf. `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx` in `/auth/userinfo` API response). The authorization server
        implementation should prepare values of the verified claims listed in `requestedVerifiedClaimsForTx`
        and pass them as the value of this `verifiedClaimsForTx` request parameter.
        
        The following is an example of the value of this request parameter.
        
        ```
        [
          "{\"birthdate\":\"1970-01-23\",\"nationalities\":[\"DEU\",\"USA\"]}"
        ]
        ```
        
        The reason that this `verifiedClaimsForTx` property is an array is that the `"verified_claims"`
        property in the claims request parameter of an authorization request can be an array like below.
        
        ```
        {
          "transformed_claims": {
            "nationality_usa": {
              "claim": "nationalities",
              "fn": [
                [ "eq", "USA" ],
                "any"
              ]
            }
          },
          "userinfo": {
            "verified_claims": [
              {
                "verification": { "trust_framework": { "value": "gold" } },
                "claims": { "::18_or_above": null }
              },
              {
                "verification": { "trust_framework": { "value": "silver" } },
                "claims": { ":nationality_usa": null }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        
        For the example above, the value of this `verifiedClaimsForTx` property should be an array of
        size 2 and look like below. The first element is JSON including claims which have been verified
        under the trust framework `"gold"`, and the second element is JSON including claims which have
        been verified under the trust framework `"silver"`.
        
        ```
        [
          "{\"birthdate\":\"1970-01-23\"}",
          "{\"nationalities\":[\"DEU\",\"USA\"]}"
        ]
