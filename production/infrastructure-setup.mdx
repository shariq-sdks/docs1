# Infrastructure Setup

This guide covers the essential infrastructure components and configurations needed to deploy Authlete in production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your Authlete infrastructure, ensure you have:

- **Authlete Account** - Active service subscription
- **Domain Configuration** - Valid domain for your authorization server
- **SSL/TLS Certificates** - Valid certificates for HTTPS endpoints
- **DNS Configuration** - Proper DNS records for your domain

## Core Infrastructure Components

### 1. Authorization Server

The authorization server is the core component that handles OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows.

**Key Requirements:**
  - High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Load balancing for traffic distribution
- SSL/TLS termination
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

### 2. Token Endpoint

Secure endpoint for token issuance and refresh operations.

**Configuration:**
  ```yaml
endpoints:
  token: "https://auth.yourdomain.com/oauth/token"
  introspection: "https://auth.yourdomain.com/oauth/introspect"
  revocation: "https://auth.yourdomain.com/oauth/revoke"
```

### 3. UserInfo Endpoint

Provides user information for OpenID Connect implementations.

**Configuration:**
  ```yaml
endpoints:
  userinfo: "https://auth.yourdomain.com/oauth/userinfo"
  jwks: "https://auth.yourdomain.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
```

## Deployment Options

### Cloud Deployment

**Recommended Cloud Providers:**
  - AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure
- DigitalOcean

**Key Considerations:**
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
- Global CDN integration
- Managed database services
- Security and compliance features

### On-Premises Deployment

For organizations requiring on-premises deployment:

**Requirements:**
  - Container orchestration (Kubernetes/Docker Swarm)
- Load balancer configuration
- Database setup (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

## Security Configuration

### SSL/TLS Setup

1. **Certificate Management**
   - Use Let's Encrypt for free certificates
   - Implement certificate auto-renewal
   - Configure HSTS headers

2. **Cipher Suites**
   - Use strong encryption algorithms
   - Disable weak protocols (TLS 1.0, 1.1)
   - Implement perfect forward secrecy

### Network Security

- **Firewall Rules** - Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **VPC Configuration** - Isolate services in private subnets
- **WAF Integration** - Web Application Firewall for additional protection

## Database Configuration

### Primary Database

**Requirements:**
  - High availability setup
- Automated backups
- Encryption at rest
- Connection pooling

**Recommended Setup:**
  ```yaml
database:
  type: "postgresql"
  version: "13+"
  replicas: 3
  backup: "daily"
  encryption: "enabled"
```

### Caching Layer

Implement Redis for session and token caching:

```yaml
cache:
  type: "redis"
  cluster: "enabled"
  persistence: "aof"
  memory: "8gb"
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Response times
  - Throughput (requests/second)
  - Error rates
  - Database connection pools

- **Security Metrics**
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Suspicious activity patterns
  - Certificate expiration dates

### Alerting Configuration

Set up alerts for:
  - High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>2s)
- Database connection issues
- Certificate expiration (30 days)

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Service Settings** - Set up your OAuth 2.0 service
2. **Register Clients** - Add your applications
3. **Test Endpoints** - Verify all endpoints are working
4. **Set Up Monitoring** - Implement logging and alerting
5. **Go Live** - Deploy to production
