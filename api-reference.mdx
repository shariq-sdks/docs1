# Authelete API

Authlete is an API-first service where every aspect of the platform is configurable via API.

At a high level, the Authlete API is grouped into two categories:

- Management APIs: Enable you to manage services and clients. üîß
- Runtime APIs: Allow you to build your own Authorization Servers or Verifiable Credential (VC) issuers. üîê

All API endpoints are secured using access tokens issued by Authlete's Identity Provider (IdP). If you already have an Authlete account, simply use the Get Token option on the Authentication page to log in and obtain an access token for API usage.

If you don't have an account yet, sign up here to get started.

## Error Handling

All API endpoints return consistent error responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "resultCode": "A004001",
  "resultMessage": "Error description",
  "resultDescription": "Detailed error information"
}
```

Common error codes:

- **A004001**: Invalid request parameters
- **A004002**: Authentication required
- **A004003**: Insufficient permissions
- **A004004**: Resource not found
- **A004005**: Internal server error
