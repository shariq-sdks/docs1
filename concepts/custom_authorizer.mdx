# What is Custom Authorizer?

3. What is Custom Authorizer?

On Feb 11, 2016, a blog entry of AWS Compute Blog, “[Introducing custom authorizers in Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway)”, announced that **Custom Authorizer** had been introduced into Amazon API Gateway.

Thanks to this mechanism, an API built on Amazon API Gateway can delegate validation of a Bearer token (such as an OAuth or SAML token) presented by a client application to an external authorizer. The figure below is an excerpt from the online document “[Enable Amazon API Gateway Custom Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html)” and “Lambda Auth function” at the top position in the figure is an authorizer. API Gateway delegates validation of a token to the authorizer if it is configured so.

As the same as before, Amazon API Gateway itself does not provide OAuth server functionalities, but you can protect APIs built on Amazon API Gateway by OAuth access tokens by utilizing Custom Authorizer.

3. What is Custom Authorizer?

The [online document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html) and the [blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway) show implementation examples of an authorizer. However, the example in the online document uses `allow`, `deny` and `unauthorized` as token values in order to simplify the code example, so it is not a practical example. On the other hand, the example in the blog uses JWT ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) as a token value, so it is a practical example. But, it does not include any code to make a query to an external server to get information about a token. It is because JWT is a form where information is embedded in a token itself, and so information can be extracted only by decoding the token value.

That is, there is no example to communicate with an authorization server to get information about an access token. The lack of a code example for the use case is unfriendly to developers considering the following.

- An authorizer has to be implemented as an AWS Lambda function.
- As a language for AWS Lambda implementation, node.js is recommended more than others.
- There is no standardized way to process network communication synchronously in node.js (AFAIK).

So, in the next section, we’ll show you an authorizer example written in node.js which communicates with an authorization server to get information about an access token.

3. What is Custom Authorizer?

We show an authorizer example written in node.js which communicates with an external authorization server.

The introspection API used here is not the one defined in [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) (OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection) but [Authlete’s introspection API](/developers/definitive_guide/protected_resource/#authlete-introspection-api). However, you can still get generic knowledge as to the following points.

1. How to extract the HTTP method and the resource path of the request from the value of `event.methodArn`.(in `extract_method_and_path` function)
1. How to extract an access token which is embedded in the form defined in [RFC 6750, 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1). from the value of event.authorizationToken.(in `extract_access_token` function)
1. How to complete network communication with an authorization server synchronously in `exports.handler` using waterfall function of *async* module.
1. How to communicate with an introspection API of an authorization server using *request* module.(in `introspect` function)
1. How an authorizer generates a response to API Gateway.(in `generate_policy` function)
1. How to set an HTTP status code to reject an request.(in `exports.handler` function)

## Create a lambda function deployment package

Here we show how to create a lambda function deployment package including the custom authorizer code above.

First, download [index.js](https://gist.github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/b735945f5424ada6a7ee) from Gist.

Then, open the file with a text editor and replace `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` with actual values. Please use a pair of API credentials issued to you by Authlete. A pair of API credentials is issued when you sign up Authlete. Also, another pair is issued when you add a new service in [Service Owern Console](/developers/so_console/). See “[Getting Started](/developers/getting_started/)” for details.

Next, modify the implementation of `get_required_scopes` function as necessary. The role of the method is to return a list of necessary scopes based on the HTTP method and the resource path of a request. See the comment in `index.js` for details.

Then, move to the directory where `index.js` is placed and execute the following commands to install async module and requet module.

```
$ npm install async request

```

Operations so far have created `index.js` file and `node_modules` directory.

```
$ ls -1F
index.js
node_modules
```

Finally, create a ZIP file containing these. The ZIP file is a lambda function deployment package. Upload it to AWS Lambda.

Note that it is recommended to set the timeout value of the lambda function longer than the default value because the Custom Authorizer implementation communicates with an external authorization server.

## Configure Custom Authorizer

See [the online document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html) and [the blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway) about how to use the uploaded lambda function as an implementation of Custom Authoriser.

# Test
1. [Home](https://www.authlete.com/)
3. What is Custom Authorizer?

Here we assume that GET mydemoresource (which is created by going through the steps described in the Amazon API Gateway online document, “Walkthrough: Create API Gateway API for Lambda Functions”) is protected by the Custom Authorizer.

First, access mydemoresource without an access token. Don’t forget to replace `` and `` with your own.

```
curl -v -s -k https://.execute-api..amazonaws.com/test/mydemoresource

```

You will receive “*401 Unauthorized*” when you execute the above command.

Next, access the API with an access token. Here we assume that `puql0-wO_vwuxupctHgNem5-__b256tYgFcu_CXvc7w` is a valid access token. (See the next section as to how to issue an access token.)

```
curl -v -s -k https://.execute-api..amazonaws.com/test/mydemoresource \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer puql0-wO_vwuxupctHgNem5-__b256tYgFcu_CXvc7w'

```

A successful response returns an HTTP status code “200 OK” and a JSON ``.

## How to issue an access token

Authlete provides the default implementation of an [authorization endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1) at the following URL:

```
https://api.authlete.com/api/auth/authorization/direct
```

The default implementation is called a direct endpoint and it is enabled by default. If you utilize the endpoint, you can issue an access token without using [java-oauth-server](https://github.com/authlete/java-oauth-server).

The following URL is an example to get an access token issued using Implicit Flow. Don’t forget to replace `` and `` with your own.

```
https://api.authlete.com/api/auth/authorization/direct/?client_id=&response_type=token

```

Access the URL above by your browser, and an authorization page is displayed. Input the API key and the API secret of your service in the login form in the authorization page. After successful login, an access token is issued. See “[Getting Started](/developers/getting_started/)” for details.

**Congratulations!** You have succeeded in protecting APIs built on Amazon API Gateway by OAuth access tokens using Amazon API Gateway Custom AuthorizerCongratulations!
