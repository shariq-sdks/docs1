# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for the Authlete IdP.
This new version was made available on July 3rd (Thu).

# IdP

## Audit log fetching improvements

- Improved audit log fetching logic so that logs can now be fetched from multiple API servers asychronously
- Improved `GET auditlogs` endpoint so that it now includes audit logs from the server

This allows to handle cases where a service was moved from one organization to another

## Password check improvements

Improved password check feature so that it automatically blocks the submission of blacklisted passwords, instead of only flagging them as unsafe.

## IdP exception handler fix

Fixed an issue where the IdPâ€™s exception handler fails to properly resolve an exception to a returnable error response whenever the HTTP status code value is not set.
