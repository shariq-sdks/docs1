# Overview of This Release

This is a minor update of Authlete 2.2. It includes the following new or enhanced features since [the version 2.2.25](../2.2.25).

# Newly Supported Standard Specifications

N/A

# New Configuration Items

## DCR with Duplicate Software ID

When “Block” is selected, Authlete checks duplication of the value of `software_id` parameter (which is one of client metadata) in a DCR (Dynamic Client Registration) request. If there is already the same value in the database, Authlete rejects the DCR request.

When “Accept” is selected, Authlete does not do the check as described above.

# Added or Updated APIs

## Generating Access Token (added)

`accessToken` is a new request parameter added to the following APIs so that you can specify a value of a new access token by yourself instead of generating the value by the Authlete server.

- `/auth/authorization/issue` API
- `/auth/token` API
- `/auth/token/issue` API
- `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API

## /auth/token/revoke API (added)

`/auth/token/revoke` is a new API to revoke tokens. You can specify the following conditions for target access tokens and/or refresh tokens to be revoked.

- `accessTokenIdentifier`
- `clientIdentifier`
- `refreshTokenIdentifier`
- `subject`

Up to 20 tokens can be revoked in a single request to the API.
