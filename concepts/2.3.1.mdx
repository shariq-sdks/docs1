# New Service Configuration Items

## Token / Idempotency

If “Enabled” is selected, refresh token requests with the same refresh token can be made multiple times in quick succession and they can obtain the same renewed refresh token within the short period.
If “Disabled” is selected, each refresh token request receives a different renewed refresh token even if they are made in a short period.

# New Client Configuration Items

## Authorization / Redirect URIs

Changed the maximum number of characters for Redirect URIs from 200 to 1000.

## Authorization / Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636)

If “Required” is selected, the `code_challenge` request parameter is required whenever this client makes an authorization request by the authorization code flow.

## Authorization / S256 for Code Challenge Method

If “Required” is selected, `S256` is required as the code challenge method whenever this client uses PKCE ([RFC 7636](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html)).

## Token / Single Access Token Per Subject

If “Enabled” is selected, an attempt to issue a new access token invalidates existing access tokens that are associated with the same combination of subject and client.
Even if Disabled is selected, single access token per subject is effective if “Single Access Token Per Subject” of the Service this client belongs to is Enabled.

# Added or Updated APIs
