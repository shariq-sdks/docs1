3. Overview

## Added support for Native SSO

Implemented single sign-on across native mobile apps, which includes the following API changes :

- Added the `nativeSsoRequested` response parameter to the `/auth/authorization API`
- Added the `sessionId` request parameter to the `auth/authorization/issue` API
- Added the `sessionId`, `deviceSecret`, `deviceSecretHash` response parameters to the `auth/token` API
- Added a new `/nativesso` API
- Added the `native_sso_supported` metadata to the `/service/configuration` API
- Added the new `nativeSsoSupported` property to the `/service/create` API
- Added the `nativeSsoSupported` property to the `/service/update` API
- Added the capability to logout from all applications through the `/nativesso/logout` API

New activity log events have also been added as necessary.

## IP token duration per client

Added the ability to define ID token duration at client level.
Of all non-zero positive numbers the smallest one will be used as the duration for the ID token.

## Client list API performance improvements

Added index to `access_token` table in order to reduce response time when querying the API for the list of clients a subject has granted access to.
