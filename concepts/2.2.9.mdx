## Parameterized Scopes (added)

This release supports parameterized scopes. By specifying a special pair of attributes (`regex` as a key and a regular expression (e.g. `^consent:.+$`) as a value) for a scope (e.g. `consent`), Authlete treats a matched scope value (e.g. `consent:urn:bancoex:C1DD33123`) as valid.

See [JavaDoc of DynamicScope class](http://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/DynamicScope.html) in our authlete-java-common library for details.
