# OpenID Connect Basics

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

## Key Concepts

### Identity Provider (IdP)
The server that authenticates users and provides identity information about them.

### Relying Party (RP)
The client application that wants to verify the identity of a user.

### ID Token
A JWT that contains identity information about the user, including their unique identifier and other claims.

### UserInfo Endpoint
An OAuth 2.0 protected resource that returns claims about the authenticated end-user.

## Authentication Flows

### Authorization Code Flow
The most secure flow for server-side applications, using authorization codes to obtain tokens.

### Implicit Flow
A simplified flow for client-side applications, where access tokens are returned directly.

### Hybrid Flow
Combines features of both authorization code and implicit flows.

## Claims

Claims are pieces of information about the user, such as their name, email, or profile picture. They can be included in the ID token or retrieved from the UserInfo endpoint.

### Standard Claims
- `sub` (subject): Unique identifier for the user
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address
- `picture`: Profile picture URL

### Custom Claims
Additional claims specific to your application or organization.

## Discovery

OpenID Connect Discovery allows clients to dynamically discover information about OpenID Providers, including their endpoints and capabilities.

## Security Considerations

- Always verify ID token signatures
- Check token expiration times
- Validate the `aud` (audience) claim
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper nonce validation
