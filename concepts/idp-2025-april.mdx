## Minor bug fixes

- The incorrect section is highlighted in the UI sidebar
- The admin dashboard does not return to the login screen when the user is logged out
- Fixed an issue where the `AuditEventInterceptor` would throw an NPE error whenever the Spring session is `null`.

- Fixed an issue where the GitHub social login did not work whenever the user has either no first name or last name.
- Fixed unhandled error whenever the user tries to attach the same domain to multiple OIDC configurations.
- Fixed an issue where user agents exceeding the 256 characters limit would prevent audit logs to be saved.
- Fixed an issue where API servers without service would unexpectedly log out the user.
- Fixed an NPE that would happen whenever the token update response from the server does not contain an `action` field.
