# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for the Authlete Management Console.
This new version was made available on July 29th (Tue).

# Management Console

## HSM support

Implemented UI to add hardware security keys, view them in a paginated table, and remove them.

## Feedback form fix

Fixed an issue where the feedback form would not display correctly on the console UI.

## Client ID import fix

Fixed an issue where client IDs would sometimes be incorrectly imported.

## Other UI improvements

- Removed the `Enable HSM` switch from the UI whenever the environment does not have hardware security modules configured
- Removed `Customer Organizations` from the admin dashboard (for self-managed customers only)
- Improved the overall design of the admin dashboard (for self-managed customers only)
- Improved console UI to limit the number of clients fetched in a single call
- Fixed an issue where long URIs in then Request URIs field would cause some UI elements to overflow beyond the intended frame
