# Newly Supported Standard Specifications

# New Configuration Items

## OpenID on Refresh (Service configuration)

If “Remove unless offline_access” is selected, the `openid` scope is dropped from a new access token issued by the refresh token flow unless the presented refresh token contains the `offline_access` scope. On the other hand, if “No action” is selected, nothing special is performed.

## DPoP Required (Client configuration)

If “Required” is selected, The client is forced to use DPoP. Any access token request or usage that does not use DPoP will be rejected.

# Added or Updated APIs

## /auth/introspection API

Return `grantType` in token introspection response.

## /service/configuration API

Add `patch` request parameter to `/api/service/configuration` API for patching the response content.
