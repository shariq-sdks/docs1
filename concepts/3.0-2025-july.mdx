# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for Authlete 3.0.
This new version was made available on July 24th (Thu).

# New Features & Improvements

## Service Principal implementation

Added service principal identifier to audit logs, which will be used whenever entries are generated by the system.
Note : Currently this is only a server-side change, with the UI coming in the near future.

## Client assertion improvements

Improved client assertion audience logic so that validation can be enforced only for FAPI2 modes.

## Request coalescing improvements

Changed request coalescing setting to off by default.
Request coalescing is a performance tuning feature which should be only enabled when necessary and can cause race conditions if misused.

- `/api/client/authorization/get/list`
- `/api/client/get/list`
- `/api/hsk/get/list`
- `/api/service/assertionprocessor/list`
- `/api/service/get/list`

## Service update endpoint fix

Removed redundant requirement to include apiKey in payload for `/api/{serviceId}/service/update` endpoint.
