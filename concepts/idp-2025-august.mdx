# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for the Authlete IdP.
This new version was made available on August 28th (Thu).

# IdP

## Orphaned services fetch improvements

Improved server logic to retrieve orphaned services faster.

## Audit logs User ID fix

Fixed an issue where the User ID field in the audit logs UI would be displayed as `null` when omitted.

## Legacy IDs storage fix

Fixed an issue where older entity IDs were stored as `int` instead of `long`.

## Token deletion fix

Fixed an issue where organization and service token deletion would fail in some cases.

## Other UI improvements

- Fixed an issue where a user could get stuck in the invitation flow if they closed the session without completing the user creation step
- Remove user agreement checkboxes from signup flow (for self-hosted environments only)
