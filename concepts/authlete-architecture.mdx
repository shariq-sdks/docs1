# Authlete Architecture

Authlete provides a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect implementation as a service, allowing you to focus on your application logic rather than complex authentication and authorization protocols.

## Core Components

### Management APIs
APIs for managing services, clients, and configurations:
- Service management
- Client registration and management
- Scope and claim configuration
- Security settings

### Runtime APIs
APIs for implementing authorization servers:
- Authorization endpoint processing
- Token endpoint processing
- UserInfo endpoint processing
- Token introspection and revocation

## Service Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design
Each Authlete service operates independently with its own:
- Client registrations
- User data
- Configuration settings
- Security policies

### Global Infrastructure
Authlete operates across multiple regions:
- US (us.authlete.com)
- Japan (jp.authlete.com)
- Europe (eu.authlete.com)
- Brazil (br.authlete.com)

## Integration Patterns

### Backend Integration
Your authorization server acts as a proxy, forwarding requests to Authlete APIs and handling responses.

### Frontend Integration
Client applications interact with your authorization server, which processes requests using Authlete APIs.

## Security Model

### API Authentication
All Authlete APIs are secured using:
- Service API keys for management operations
- Access tokens for runtime operations

### Data Isolation
Each service's data is completely isolated from other services, ensuring privacy and security.

## Scalability

### Auto-Scaling
Authlete automatically scales to handle varying loads without configuration.

### High Availability
Built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms ensure high availability.
