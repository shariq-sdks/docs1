# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for the Authlete IdP.
This new version was made available on June 11th (Wed).

# IdP

## Authenticator settings UX improvements

Added a new step to the flow to clearly separate recovery codes from the authenticator registration step.

## SMTP configuration fix

Fixed an issue where SMTP configuration properties would not be correctly initialized before caching.

## Started enforcing minimum password strength

As part of this effort, we have also blacklisted a series of unsecure passwords such as `admin`, `password`, etc â€¦
