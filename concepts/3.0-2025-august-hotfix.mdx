## clientIdAlias metadata fix

Fixed an issue where the `clientIdAlias` metadata was treated as mandatory during client update calls, and where updates would attempt to overwrite the existing value with null if no value was passed.

- This fix ensures a missing alias preserves the current value while still allowing callers to supply a new alias
