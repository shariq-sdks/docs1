# Overview

This hotfix introduces changes for Authlete 3.0.
This new version was made available on August 12th (Thu).

# New Features & Improvements

## Primary Key support

Added primary key to all DB tables where it was previously missing.

# Bug fixes

## clientIdAlias metadata fix

Fixed an issue where the `clientIdAlias` metadata was treated as mandatory during client update calls, and where updates would attempt to overwrite the existing value with null if no value was passed.

- This fix ensures a missing alias preserves the current value while still allowing callers to supply a new alias
