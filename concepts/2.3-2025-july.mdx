# Overview

This minor update introduces changes for Authlete 2.3.
This new version was made available on July 24th (Thu).

# New Features & Improvements

## Client assertion improvements

Improved client assertion audience logic so that validation can be enforced only for FAPI2 modes.

## Request coalescing improvements

Changed request coalescing setting to off by default.
Request coalescing is a performance tuning feature which should be only enabled when necessary and can cause race conditions if misused.

- `/api/hsk/get/list`
- `/api/service/assertionprocessor/list`
