## Authlete Overview

Authlete is a **BaaS (Backend as a Service)** providing a comprehensive set of APIs for implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization servers and OpenID Connect identity providers.

### What is Authlete?

Authlete provides a complete OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization server implementation as a service. Instead of building your own authorization server from scratch, you can use Authlete's APIs to handle:

- **OAuth 2.0 Flows**: Authorization Code, Client Credentials, Device Flow, and more
- **OpenID Connect**: User authentication and identity information
- **Client Management**: Register and manage OAuth clients
- **Service Management**: Configure your authorization server
- **Token Management**: Issue, validate, and revoke access tokens

### Architecture

Authlete follows a **microservices architecture** where every component is exposed as an API:

- **Management APIs**: Configure services and clients
- **Runtime APIs**: Handle OAuth/OIDC flows
- **Token APIs**: Manage access and refresh tokens
- **User APIs**: Handle user authentication and profiles
