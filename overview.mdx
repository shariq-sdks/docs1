# What is Authlete?

Authlete is a managed-cloud/on-prem solution that provides Web APIs to implement [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/). Using [our Web APIs](/api-specification), you can easily get the functionality of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

# Why Authlete?

A company has to implement OAuth 2.0 (and OpenID Connect) as prerequisites to provide Web APIs of its service. However, it requires enormous time and effort to implement the specifications. Also, managing data related to the specifications is an annoyance. This hurdle could prove fatal to service providers who compete on time to market and/or cannot afford to implement the prerequisites only with their developer resources.

It is Authlete that solves the problem. Authlete does support an overwhelming number of related specifications and host related data. Authlete users can start to implement Web APIs of their services without being bothered with the prerequisites.

# How Authlete Works

Authlete is a backend as a service and provides APIs that help you to implement OAuth and OpenID Connect. Authlete works behind your web service and does not interact directly with your end-users, OAuth clients, or relying parties.

# Authlete Feature
>>>>>>> 7609f16f77090ff1f3a3d1c20c5c1b52cb1c2f60

The Authlete "semi-hosted" architecture enables you to:

##### Build authorization servers with your favorite programming languages and frameworks

Authlete has designed and implemented all functions necessary to implement an OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect server as Web APIs. On top of the functions to manage metadata of client applications and authorization servers, Authlete also provides functions to implement endpoints such as an authorization endpoint and a token endpoint.

This unique architecture enables developers to use any programming language, including Java, Ruby, PHP and C#. [Our OSS libraries and sample implementations](https://github.com) will help you build OAuth/OIDC servers within a few days or weeks.

##### Manage multiple OAuth/OIDC servers and API Clients with one Authlete

Authlete can run and manage multiple instances of OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect servers simultaneously, which can be managed by consoles.

It is easy to set up new instances: an architect therefore can place multiple authorization servers in a system wherever appropriate without a huge development cost. For example, an architect may have a separate authorization servers for smartphone applications from internal services.

##### Prevent from sharing your end-users' credentials with third-party OAuth/OIDC services

Authlete receives subjects of end-users from your system and associates the subjects with access tokens and other data. Therefore, you don't have to share your end-users credentials with us, which is quite unique compared with other API authorization solutions.

##### ClientID Alias

![client_id_alias](https://storage.googleapis.com/authlete-website/img/developers/overview/client_id_alias_en.png)

Authlete allows each client to have a client ID alias in addition to the client ID.

This function would be useful when you migrate from the existing authorization server to Authlete and keep using the existing client IDs in the new Authlete system.

Please refer to [this document](/ja/kb/oauth-and-openid-connect/client-id-alias) for more details.

##### Access/Refresh Token Duration per Scope or Client

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/authlete-website/img/developers/overview/token_duration_en.png)

You can shorten the access token and refresh token duration per scope using [the scope attribute functionality](/kb/oauth-and-openid-connect/scope-attributes).

To activate this feature, set up a scope that has a scope attribute with its key of `access_token.duration` or `refresh_token.duration` and value of a "shorter" token duration in second. The duration of the tokens with the scope will be the duration set in the scope attribute. Please refer to [this document](/kb/oauth-and-openid-connect/token-duration-per-scope) for more details.

Also, you can shorten the access token and refresh token duration per client by configuring from the client developer console.

##### Forced S256 for Code Challenge Method

With this option, Authlete only accepts a request with `code_challenge_method` = `S256` when using PKCE protocol.

You can configure this setting from the "Authorization" tab in the service owner console.

##### Granted Scopes Management

Authlete enables customers to get a list of (or remove) scopes that are granted end-users.

This function is only available for Enterprise Plan users.

##### Allowable Clock Skew

The allowable clock skew between the server and clients is configurable in seconds.

##### Binding Message in FAPI Context

Authlete can reject requests without `binding_message` request parameter in FAPI-CIBA protocols.
