# Client Management

Client management involves registering, configuring, and maintaining OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect clients in your Authlete service.

## Client Registration

### Client Types
- **Public Clients**: Cannot securely store credentials (mobile apps, SPAs)
- **Confidential Clients**: Can securely store credentials (web applications, server-side apps)

### Registration Process
1. Create client with basic information
2. Configure authentication methods
3. Set up redirect URIs
4. Configure grant types and response types
5. Set security policies

## Client Configuration

### Basic Settings
- Client name and description
- Client type selection
- Logo and branding
- Contact information

### Authentication Configuration
- Client authentication method
- Client secret management
- PKCE requirements
- Token endpoint authentication

### Endpoint Configuration
- Redirect URIs
- Post-logout redirect URIs
- Client URI
- Policy URI
- Terms of service URI

## Grant Types and Response Types

### Supported Grant Types
- Authorization Code
- Client Credentials
- Refresh Token
- Device Code
- JWT Bearer

### Response Types
- Code
- Token
- ID Token
- Code + Token
- Code + ID Token

## Security Configuration

### Client Secrets
- Secret generation
- Secret rotation
- Secret validation
- Secure storage

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- Code challenge methods
- Code verifier requirements
- S256 enforcement
- Plain method support

### Security Policies
- Token binding
- Request object validation
- JWT assertion requirements
- Custom security rules

## Scope and Permission Management

### Scope Configuration
- Available scopes
- Default scopes
- Required scopes
- Scope attributes

### Permission Management
- Client permissions
- User consent requirements
- Permission revocation
- Access control policies

## Client Lifecycle Management

### Client States
- Active
- Inactive
- Suspended
- Deleted

### Client Operations
- Update client information
- Rotate client secrets
- Manage redirect URIs
- Update security settings

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Client Usage
- API call statistics
- Token issuance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance tracking

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Suspicious activity detection
- Token abuse monitoring
- Security incident tracking
