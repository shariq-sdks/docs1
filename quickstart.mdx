## Quick Start Guide

Get started with Authlete API in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through setting up your first service and making your first API call.

## Prerequisites

- An Authlete account ([Sign up here](https://console.authlete.com/register))
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 concepts
- Your preferred programming language and HTTP client

## Step 1: Create a Service

First, you'll need to create a service in the Authlete Console:

1. Go to [console.authlete.com](https://console.authlete.com)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Click "Create Service"
4. Fill in your service details:
   - **Service Name**: Your application name
   - **Description**: Brief description of your service
   - **Service Profile**: Choose based on your needs

## Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

After creating your service, you'll get:

- **Service API Key**: Used to identify your service
- **Service API Secret**: Used to authenticate API calls

<Warning>
Keep your API secret secure and never expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Make Your First API Call

Let's test the connection by calling the "Get Service" API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get', 
\`});

const service = await response.json();
console.log(service);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = 

response = requests.get(
    'https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get',
    headers=headers
)

service = response.json()
print(service)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Create Your First Client

Now let's create an OAuth client:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://us.authlete.com/api/client/create" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d ''
```

```javascript JavaScript
const clientData = ;

const response = await fetch('https://us.authlete.com/api/client/create', ,
  body: JSON.stringify(clientData)
});

const client = await response.json();
console.log('Client ID:', client.clientId);
```

```python Python
import requests

client_data = 

headers = 

response = requests.post(
    'https://us.authlete.com/api/client/create',
    headers=headers,
    json=client_data
)

client = response.json()
print(f"Client ID: ")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: Test the OAuth Flow

Now you can test the complete OAuth 2.0 authorization flow:

1. **Authorization Request**: Direct users to the authorization endpoint
2. **Authorization Response**: Handle the callback with the authorization code
3. **Token Request**: Exchange the code for an access token
4. **Token Response**: Use the access token to access protected resources
