    description: |
      The session ID of the user's authentication session. The specified value will be embedded in the
      ID token as the value of the `sid` claim. This parameter needs to be provided only if you want
      to support the [OpenID Connect Native SSO for Mobile Apps 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html)
      specification (a.k.a. "Native SSO"). To enable support for the Native SSO specification, the
      `nativeSsoSupported` property of your service must be set to `true`.

      NOTE: When the response from the `/auth/authorization` API contains the `nativeSsoRequested`
      property with a value of `true`, the `sessionId` request parameter must be provided to the
      `/auth/authorization/issue` API.

      | "string" | The type of the aud claim is always a single string. |
      | null | The type of the aud claim remains the same as before. |

      This request parameter takes precedence over the `idTokenAudType` property of the service.
