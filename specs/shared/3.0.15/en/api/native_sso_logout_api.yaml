  summary: Native SSO Logout Processing
  description: |
    The `/nativesso/logout` API is supposed to be used to support the concept of "logout from all applications"
    in the context of [OpenID Connect Native SSO for Mobile Apps 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html)
    (Native SSO). This is accomplished by deleting access/refresh token records associated with the
    specified session ID. In Authlete's implementation, access/refresh token records can be associated
    with a session ID only through the mechanism introduced by Native SSO.

    A response from the `/nativesso/logout` API contains `action` response parameter. The possible values
    are:

    **OK**

    When the action is `OK`, it indicates that the `/nativesso/logout` API call completed successfully.

    **SERVER_ERROR**

    When the action is `SERVER_ERROR`, it indicates that something has gone wrong on the Authlete side.

    **CALLER_ERROR**

    When the action is `CALLER_ERROR`, it indicates that the `/nativesso/logout` API call contained a
    problem. For example, the call may have been missing the required request parameter `sessionId`.
