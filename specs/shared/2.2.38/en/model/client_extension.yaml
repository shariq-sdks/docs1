properties:
  requestableScopes:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      The set of scopes that the client application is allowed to request. This paramter will be one
      of the following.

        - `null`
        - an empty set
        - a set with at least one element

      When the value of this parameter is `null`, it means that the set of scopes that the client
      application is allowed to request is the set of the scopes that the service supports. When the
      value of this parameter is an empty set, it means that the client application is not allowed to
      request any scopes. When the value of this parameter is a set with at least one element, it means
      that the set is the set of scopes that the client application is allowed to request.
  requestableScopesEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag to indicate whether "Requestable Scopes per Client" is enabled or not. If `true`, you
      can define the set of scopes which this client application can request. If `false`, this client
      application can request any scope which is supported by the authorization server.
  accessTokenDuration:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: |
      The value of the duration of access tokens per client in seconds. In normal cases, the value of
      the service's `accessTokenDuration` property is used as the duration of access tokens issued by
      the service. However, if this `accessTokenDuration` property holds a non-zero positive number
      and its value is less than the duration configured by the service, the value is used as the duration
      of access tokens issued to the client application.

      Note that the duration of access tokens can be controlled by the scope attribute `access_token.duration`,
      too. Authlete chooses the minimum value among the candidates.
  refreshTokenDuration:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: |
      The value of the duration of refresh tokens per client in seconds. In normal cases, the value
      of the service's `refreshTokenDuration` property is used as the duration of refresh tokens issued
      by the service. However, if this `refreshTokenDuration` property holds a non-zero positive number
      and its value is less than the duration configured by the service, the value is used as the duration
      of refresh tokens issued to the client application.

      Note that the duration of refresh tokens can be controlled by the scope attribute `refresh_token.duration`,
      too. Authlete chooses the minimum value among the candidates.
