  authorizationServers:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      The identifiers of the authorization servers that the credential issuer relies on for authorization.
      This property corresponds to the authorization_servers metadata. When the credential issuer works
      as an authorization server for itself, this property should be omitted.
  credentialIssuer:
    type: string
    description: The identifier of a credential request.
  credentialEndpoint:
    type: boolean
    description: The URL of the credential endpoint of the credential issuer.
  batchCredentialEndpoint:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: The URL of the batch credential endpoint of the credential issuer.
  deferredCredentialEndpoint:
    type: string
    description: The URL of the deferred credential endpoint of the credential issuer.
  credentialsSupported:
    type: boolean
    description: A JSON array describing supported credentials.
  credentialResponseEncryptionAlgValuesSupported:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      The supported JWE `alg` algorithms for credential response encryption. This property corresponds
      to the `credential_response_encryption.alg_values_supported` metadata.
  credentialResponseEncryptionEncValuesSupported:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      The supported JWE `enc` algorithms for credential response encryption. This property corresponds
      to the `credential_response_encryption.enc_values_supported` metadata.
  requireCredentialResponseEncryption:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The boolean flag indicating whether credential response encryption is required. This property
      corresponds to the `credential_response_encryption.encryption_required metadata`. If this flag
      is `true`, every credential request to the credential issuer must include the `credential_response_encryption`
      property.
