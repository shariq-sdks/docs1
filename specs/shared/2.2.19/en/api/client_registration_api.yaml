  summary: /client/registration API
  description: |
    Register a client. This API is supposed to be used to implement a client registration endpoint that
    complies with [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
    Registration Protocol).

    <summary>Description</summary>

    This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the client registration
    endpoint of the authorization server. The authorization server implementation should retrieve
    the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.

    **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

    When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
    server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

    In either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.
    Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with "500 Internal
    Server Error"s and `application/json`.

    The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
    the entity body of the response.

    The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
    and return to the client or developer.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {responseContent}
    ```

    The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since
    "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by the specification.

    **BAD_REQUEST**

    When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer
    was wrong.

    The authorization server implementation should generate a response with "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

    The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
    as the entity body of the response.

    The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
    and return to the client or developer.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {responseContent}
    ```

    **CREATED**

    When the value of `action` is `CREATED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is
    valid.

    The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
    "201 CREATED" and `application/json`.

    The `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.

    The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
    and return to the client or developer.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
    Content-Type: application/json
    Cache-Control: no-store
    Pragma: no-cache

    {responseContent}
    ```
