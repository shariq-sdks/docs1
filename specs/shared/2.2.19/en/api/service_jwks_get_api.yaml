  summary: /service/jwks/get API
  description: |
    This API gathers JWK Set information for a service so that its client applications can verify
    signatures by the service and encrypt their requests to the service.

    <summary>Description</summary>

    This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the jwk set endpoint of the
    service where the service that supports OpenID Connect must expose its JWK Set information so that
    client applications can verify signatures by the service and encrypt their requests to the service.
    The URI of the endpoint can be found as the value of `jwks_uri` in [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)
    if the service supports [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).
