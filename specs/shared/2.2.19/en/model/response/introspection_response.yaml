            `true` if the access token can be refreshed using the associated refresh token which had been issued
            along with the access token. `false` if the refresh token for the access token has expired or the access
            token has no associated refresh token.

        resources:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: |
            The target resources. This represents the resources specified by the `resource` request parameters
            or by the `resource` property in the request object.

            See "Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0" for details.
        accessTokenResources:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: |
            The target resources this proeprty holds may be the same as or different from the ones `resource` property holds.

            In some flows, the initial request and the subsequent token request are sent to different endpoints.
            Example flows are the Authorization Code Flow, the Refresh Token Flow, the CIBA Ping Mode, the CIBA Poll Mode and the Device Flow.
            In these flows, not only the initial request but also the subsequent token request can include the `resource` request parameters.
            The purpose of the `resource` request parameters in the token request is to narrow the range of the target resources from the original
            set of target resources requested by the preceding initial request. If narrowing down is performed, the target resources holded by the
            `resource` proeprty and the ones holded by this property are different. This property holds the narrowed set of target resources.
