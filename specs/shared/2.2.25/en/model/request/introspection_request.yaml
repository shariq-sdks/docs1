properties:
  token:

    description: An access token to introspect.
  scopes:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      A string array listing names of scopes which the caller (= a protected resource endpoint of the
      service) requires. When the content type of the request from the service is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,
      the format of `scopes` is a space-separated list of scope names.

      If this parameter is a non-empty array and if it contains a scope which is not covered by the
      access token,`action=FORBIDDEN` with `error=insufficient_scope` is returned from Authlete.
  subject:
    type: string
    description: |
      A subject (= a user account managed by the service) whom the caller (= a protected resource
      endpoint of the service) requires.

      If this parameter is not `null` and if the value does not match the subject who is associated
      with the access token, `action=FORBIDDEN` with `error=invalid_request` is returned from Authlete.

      Client certificate in PEM format, used to validate binding against access tokens using the TLS
      client certificate confirmation method.
