    readOnly: true
    description: The client ID. The value of this property is assigned by Authlete.
  clientSecret:
    type: string
    readOnly: true
    description: |
      The client secret. A random 512-bit value encoded by base64url (86 letters). The value of this
      property is assigned by Authlete.

      Note that Authlete issues a client secret even to a "public" client application, but the client
      application should not use the client secret unless it changes its client type to "confidential".
      That is, a public client application should behave as if it had not been issued a client secret.
      To be specific, a token request from a public client of Authlete should not come along with a
      client secret although [RFC 6749, 3.2.1. Client Authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2.1)
      says as follows.

      > Confidential clients or other clients issued client credentials MUST authenticate with the
      authorization server as described in Section 2.3 when making requests to the token endpoint.
  clientIdAlias:
    type: string
    description: |
      The alias of the client ID.

      Note that the client ID alias is recognized only when this client's `clientIdAliasEnabled` property
      is set to `true` AND the service's `clientIdAliasEnabled` property is also set to `true`.
  clientIdAliasEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
       The flag to indicate whether the client ID alias is enabled or not.

       Note that a service also has `clientIdAliasEnabled` property. If the service's `clientIdAliasEnabled`
       property is set to `false`, the client ID alias of this client is not recognized even if this
       client's `clientIdAliasEnabled` property is set to `true`.

  redirectUris:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      Redirect URIs that the client application uses to receive a response from the authorization endpoint.
      Requirements for a redirect URI are as follows.

      **Requirements by RFC 6749** (From [RFC 6749, 3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2))

      - Must be an absolute URI.
      - Must not have a fragment component.

      **Requirements by OpenID Connect** (From "[OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0, 2.
      Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata),
      application_type")

      - The scheme of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
      is `web` must be `https`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
      - The hostname of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
      type is `web` must not be `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
      - The scheme of the redirect URI used by a client application whose application type is `native`
      must be either (1) a custom scheme or (2) `http`, which is allowed only when the hostname part
      is `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.

      **Requirements by Authlete**

      - Must consist of printable ASCII letters only.
      - Must not exceed 200 letters.

      Note that Authlete allows the application type to be `null`. In other words, a client application
      does not have to choose `web` or `native` as its application type.
      If the application type is `null`, the requirements by OpenID Connect are not checked at runtime.

      An authorization request from a client application which has not registered any redirect URI
      fails unless at least all the following conditions are satisfied.

      - The client type of the client application is `confidential`.
      - The value of `response_type` request parameter is `code`.
      - The authorization request has the `redirect_uri` request parameter.
      - The value of `scope` request parameter does not contain `openid`.

      RFC 6749 allows partial match of redirect URI under some conditions (see [RFC 6749, 3.1.2.2.
      Registration Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.2) for
      details), but OpenID Connect requires exact match.

  jwksUri:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL pointing to the JWK Set of the client application.
      The content pointed to by the URL is JSON which complies with the format described in
      [JSON Web Key (JWK), 5. JWK Set Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5).
      The JWK Set must not include private keys of the client application.

      If the client application requests encryption for ID tokens (from the authorization/token/userinfo endpoints)
      and/or signs request objects, it must make available its JWK Set containing public keys for the
      encryption and/or the signature at the URL of `jwksUri`. The service (Authlete) fetches the JWK
      Set from the URL as necessary.

      [OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html)
      says that `jwks` must not be used when the client can use `jwks_uri`, but Authlete allows both

      * [RFC 7591 OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html)
      * [RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html)
      * [OpenID Connect Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow - Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html)

      * [OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/)

      Standard client metadata included in Client Registration Request and Client Update Request (cf.
      [OIDC DynReg](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html), [RFC 7591](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html)
      and [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)) are, if supported by Authlete, set
      to corresponding properties of the client application. For example, the value of the `client_name`
      client metadata in Client Registration/Update Request is set to the clientName property. On the
      other hand, unrecognized client metadata are discarded.

      By listing up custom client metadata in advance by using the `supportedCustomClientMetadata` property
      of Service, Authlete can recognize them and stores their values into the database. The stored
      custom client metadata values can be referenced by this property.
  frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag indicating whether encryption of request object is required when the request object
      is passed through the front channel.

      This flag does not affect the processing of request objects at the Pushed Authorization Request
      Endpoint, which is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9126/).
      Unecrypted request objects are accepted at the endpoint even if this flag is `true`.

      This flag does not indicate whether a request object is always required. There is a different
      flag, `requestObjectRequired`, for the purpose.

      Even if this flag is `false`, encryption of request object is required if the `frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired`
      flag of the service is `true`.
  requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag indicating whether the JWE alg of encrypted request object must match the `request_object_encryption_alg`
      client metadata.

      The `request_object_encryption_alg` client metadata itself is defined in [OpenID Connect Dynamic
      Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) as follows.

      > request_object_encryption_alg
      >
      > OPTIONAL. JWE [JWE] alg algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request
        Objects sent to the OP. This parameter SHOULD be included when symmetric encryption will be used,
        since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the
        symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP MAY still use other
        supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter
        is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed
        then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. The default, if omitted,
        is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.

      The point here is "The RP MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted
      Request Objects, even when this parameter is present."

      The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionAlg`. See the description
      of `requestEncryptionAlg` for details.

      Even if this flag is `false`, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionAlgMatchRequired`
      flag of the service is `true`.
  requestObjectEncryptionEncMatchRequired:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag indicating whether the JWE enc of encrypted request object must match the `request_object_encryption_enc`
      client metadata.

      The `request_object_encryption_enc` client metadata itself is defined in [OpenID Connect Dynamic
      Client Registration 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) as follows.

      > request_object_encryption_enc
      >
      > OPTIONAL. JWE enc algorithm [JWA] the RP is declaring that it may use for encrypting Request
        Objects sent to the OP. If request_object_encryption_alg is specified, the default for this
        value is A128CBC-HS256. When request_object_encryption_enc is included, request_object_encryption_alg
        MUST also be provided.

      The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionEnc`. See the description
      of `requestEncryptionEnc`  for details.

      Even if this flag is `false`, the match is required if the `requestObjectEncryptionEncMatchRequired`
      flag of the service is `true`.
  digestAlgorithm:
    type: string
    description: |
      The digest algorithm that this client requests the server to use
      when it computes digest values of <a href=
      "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#name-external-attachments"
      >external attachments</a>, which may be referenced from within ID tokens
      or userinfo responses (or any place that can have the `verified_claims` claim).

      Possible values are listed in the <a href=
      "https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg"
      >Hash Algorithm Registry</a> of IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority),
      but the server does not necessarily support all the values there. When
      this property is omitted, `sha-256` is used as the default algorithm.

      This property corresponds to the `digest_algorithm` client metadata
      which was defined by the third implementer's draft of
      [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html).
  singleAccessTokenPerSubject:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If `Enabled` is selected, an attempt to issue a new access token invalidates existing access tokens that are associated with the same combination of subject and client.

      Note that, however, attempts by Client Credentials Flow do not invalidate existing access tokens because access tokens issued by Client Credentials Flow are not associated with any end-user's subject.

      Even if `Disabled` is selected here, single access token per subject is effective if `singleAccessTokenPerSubject` of the `Service` this client belongs to is Enabled.
  pkceRequired:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag to indicate whether the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is always required for authorization requests by Authorization Code Flow.

      If `true`, `code_challenge` request parameter is always required for authorization requests using Authorization Code Flow.

      See [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) (Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients) for details about `code_challenge` request parameter.
  pkceS256Required:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      The flag to indicate whether `S256` is always required as the code challenge method whenever [PKCE (RFC 7636)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) is used.

      If this flag is set to `true`, `code_challenge_method=S256` must be included in the authorization request
      whenever it includes the `code_challenge` request parameter.
      Neither omission of the `code_challenge_method` request parameter nor use of plain (`code_challenge_method=plain`) is allowed.
  dpopRequired:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If the DPoP is required for this client
  automaticallyRegistered:
    type: boolean
