      The set of scopes that the client application is allowed to request.
      This parameter will be one of the following. Details are described in the description.

      
      - an empty set
      - a set with at least one element

      If this parameter contains scopes that the service does not support, those scopes are just
      ignored. Also, if this parameter is `null` or is not included in the request, it is equivalent
      to calling `/client/extension/requestable_scopes/delete` API.
