  summary: /api/federation/registration API
  description: |
     The Authlete API is for implementations of the <b>federation registration
     endpoint</b> that accepts "explicit client registration". Its details are
     defined in <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html"
     >OpenID Connect Federation 1.0</a>.
     </p>
    
     <p>
     The endpoint accepts `POST` requests whose `Content-Type`
     is either of the following.
     </p>
    
     <ol>
       <li>`application/entity-statement+jwt`
       <li>`application/trust-chain+json`
     </ol>
    
     <p>
     When the `Content-Type` of a request is
     `application/entity-statement+jwt`, the content of the request is
     the entity configuration of a relying party that is to be registered.
     In this case, the implementation of the federation registration endpoint
     should call Authlete's `/federation/registration` API with the
     entity configuration set to the `entityConfiguration` request
     parameter.
     </p>
    
     <p>
     On the other hand, when the `Content-Type` of a request is
     `application/trust-chain+json`, the content of the request is a
     JSON array that contains entity statements in JWT format. The sequence
     of the entity statements composes the trust chain of a relying party
     that is to be registered. In this case, the implementation of the
     federation registration endpoint should call Authlete's
     `/federation/registration` API with the trust chain set to the
     `trustChain` request parameter.
     </p>
