  Holds information about a key managed in an HSM (Hardware Security Module)

  kty:

      The key type (EC or RSA)
  use:
    type: string
    description: >
      Get the use of the key on the HSM.

      When the key use is "sig" (signature), the private key on the HSM is used
      to sign data and the corresponding public key is used to verify the
      signature.

      When the key use is "enc" (encryption), the private key on the HSM is used
      to decrypt encrypted data which have been encrypted with the corresponding
      public key
  kid:
    type: string
    description: |
      Key ID for the key on the HSM.
  hsmName:
    type: string
    description: >
      The name of the HSM.

      The identifier for the HSM that sits behind the Authlete server. For
      example, "google".
  handle:
    type: string
    description: >
      The handle for the key on the HSM.

      A handle is a base64url-encoded 256-bit random value (43 letters) which is
      assigned by Authlete on the call of the /api/hsk/create API
  publicKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The public key that corresponds to the key on the HSM.
  alg:
    type: string
    description: >
      The algorithm of the key on the HSM. When the key use is `"sig"`, the
      algorithm represents a

      signing algorithm such as `"ES256"`. When the key use is `"enc"`, the
      algorithm represents an

      encryption algorithm such as `"RSA-OAEP-256"`.
