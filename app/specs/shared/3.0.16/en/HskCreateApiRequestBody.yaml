      The key type (EC or RSA)
  use:
    type: string
    description: >
      The key on the HSM.

      When the key use is "sig" (signature), the private key on the HSM is used
      to sign data and the corresponding public key is used to verify the
      signature.

      When the key use is "enc" (encryption), the private key on the HSM is used
      to decrypt encrypted data which have been encrypted with the corresponding
      public key

      The identifier for the HSM that sits behind the Authlete server. For
      example, "google".
  alg:
    type: string
    description: >
      The algorithm of the key on the HSM. When the key use is `"sig"`, the
      algorithm represents a signing

      algorithm such as `"ES256"`. When the key use is `"enc"`, the algorithm
      represents an encryption

      algorithm such as `"RSA-OAEP-256"`.


      It is rare that HSMs support all the algorithms listed in [RFC 7518 JSON
      Web Algorithms (JWA)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html).

      When the specified algorithm is not supported by the HSM, the request to
      the `/hsk/create` API

      fails.
