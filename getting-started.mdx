## Getting Started with Authlete

This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up your Authlete account, creating your first service, and making your first API call.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A valid email address for account registration
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 concepts (optional but recommended)
- Your preferred programming language and HTTP client

### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Go to [console.authlete.com](https://console.authlete.com)
2. Click "Register" to create a new account
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your profile setup

### Step 2: Create Your First Service

1. Log in to the Authlete Console
2. Click "Create Service"
3. Fill in your service details:
   - **Service Name**: Your application name
   - **Description**: Brief description of your service
   - **Service Profile**: Choose based on your needs
4. Configure basic settings:
   - **Supported Grant Types**: Select the OAuth flows you need
   - **Supported Response Types**: Choose response types
   - **Supported Scopes**: Define your API scopes

### Step 3: Get Your API Credentials

After creating your service, you'll receive:

- **Service API Key**: Used to identify your service
- **Service API Secret**: Used to authenticate API calls

<Warning>
Keep your API secret secure and never expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Create Your First Client

1. In the Console, go to "Client Management"
2. Click "Create Client"
3. Configure your client:
   - **Client Type**: Public or Confidential
   - **Redirect URIs**: Where to redirect after authorization
   - **Grant Types**: Select appropriate flows
4. Save your client credentials

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

Let's verify everything works by calling the "Get Service" API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_API_SECRET',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_API_SECRET',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://us.authlete.com/api/service/get', headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>
